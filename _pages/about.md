Open Language Profiles (OLP) is a platform for sharing open linguistic resources for language education, or "[Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) for Language Education."

Linguistic resources (such as [CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)-aligned vocabulary lists and annotated text) play an important role in language education. However, research initiatives for developing, sharing, and utilizing such resources are distributed, independent, and not coordinated with each other. Linguistic resources developed by such initiatives follow different standards and formats, and are often distributed only under restrictive licenses.

The goal of Open Language Profiles (OLP) is to promote open, multilingual, multidisciplinary research on language education by:

* Defining a language-independent schema and format for distributing linguistic resources for education in order to promote interoperability
* Sharing multilingual resources including, but are not limited to:
    - Vocabulary and grammar profiles (word and grammatical concept lists annotated with CEFR levels)
    - Texts annotated with CEFR levels
    - Text annotation software tools
* Distributing such linguistic resources under permitting licenses (e.g., Creative Commons)

# Resources

Currently, [CEFR-j English Vocabulary and Grammar Profile datasets](https://github.com/openlanguageprofiles/olp-en-cefrj) are distributed by OLP. See the [Datasets](/datasets) page for more information.
